Volunteers with the Precious Madad Foundation were distributing blankets to the homeless sleeping outside AIIMS. We saw Chandan, who was then 12 years old, on the pavement, covered with few blankets, moaning in pain. He was with his parents who told us that he was suffering from bone cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy at AIIMS. When they ran out of cash, the family, which had travelled to Delhi from Bihar, moved to the pavement.</p><a href="#" class="button1">Read More</a> </section>

The encouragement of charity will give strength to everybody towards spiritual and emotional welfare. The society will keep you in a higher position that you deserve it. There are many paybacks and Reimbursement for supporting charity, like The donation you made for a charity will have a tax deduction according to the law, All Donations to us will be Exempted from TAX U/S 80-G OF INCOME TAX ACT 1961.
